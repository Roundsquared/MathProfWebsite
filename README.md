Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably either Cedric (Hi, Cedric!),
or Dr. Yackel if she's particuarly curious as to the contents of this file.
Either way, this is going to be an ongoing project that (hopefully) improves
alongside Cedric's skill. 

I talked with Dr. Yackel on Sept 1,2023 about her goal of making a website that
had been shelved for a couple of years. I was taking a gap semester and learning 
Front End Web Development, and I said: "Can I help design your website?" and I got
a yes, so here we are! Keep in mind, I'm *self taught* so it might not look as pretty
as some of these new fancy sites created with a framework. I'm not quite there, yet.

What I *will* try and do is make a good looking website that I can hopefully deliver 
to serve your purposes for now, and upgrade it as my skills level up. I don't know how long this process is going to take, but here's to a quick build and a happy customer! 

Now that I've yapped for long enough, we're going to include any notes about the website's development here as a quick little guide for our young adventurer.
