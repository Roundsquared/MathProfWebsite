Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably either Cedric (Hi, Cedric!),
or Dr. Yackel if she's particuarly curious as to the contents of this file.
Either way, this is going to be an ongoing project that (hopefully) improves
alongside Cedric's skill. 

I talked with Dr. Yackel on Sept 1,2023 about her goal of making a website that
had been shelved for a couple of years. I was taking a gap semester and learning 
Front End Web Development, and I said: "Can I help design your website?" and I got
a yes, so here we are! Keep in mind, I'm *self taught* so it might not look as pretty
as some of these new fancy sites created with a framework. I'm not quite there, yet.

What I *will* try and do is make a good looking website that I can hopefully deliver 
to serve your purposes for now, and upgrade it as my skills level up. I don't know how long this process is going to take, but here's to a quick build and a happy customer! 

Now that I've yapped for long enough, we're going to include any notes about the website's development here as a quick little guide for our young adventurer.

GOJO YOU CAN START HERE 

This is the site we're using for inspo: https://rantonse.org/about


11/9: Got annoyed with trying to read all of my mismanaged classes and ID's so we're tearing it down and starting from scratch. Also need to make it more readable for collaborators, since my friend Gojo from The Odin Project has volunteered his services!

To Do (no particular order):
Add styling to the header
Determine color pallette 
Add font switcher Functionality
Add Random Page Button functionality
Add Light/Dark Mode functionality
Replace Search, Fonts, Random, and Light/Dark with appropriate svgs
Add padding to nav menu items
Add hover effects to nav menu items, background color change+ text color change
Make sure links go to right pages
Add social media svgs to the bottom
Make sure social media svgs actually work when clicked
Hover effect to svgs, light up and increase in size slightly? 
Add home menu divs to left side of main (About Teaching Research Books Art)
with their descriptions
Add link to each of these div titles, with a little arrow svg tacked on the end
Add hover effect to link in main, changes color.
Add relevant images to each of the divs
Add hover effect to image, same thing, slightly larger, maybe a background color change?
Images have to be clickable, and go to the same place that their parent div goes to.
